% Prim's maximal spanning tree algorithm
% Prim's alg idea:
%  start at any node, find closest neighbor and mark edges
%  for all remaining nodes, find closest to previous cluster, mark edge
%  continue until no nodes remain
%
% INPUTS: graph defined by adjacency matrix, nxn
% OUTPUTS: matrix specifying maximum spanning tree (subgraph), nxn
%
% Other routines used: isConnected.m
